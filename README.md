# Task1
To run this script, save it as a file (e.g. apache_log_alert.sh) and make it executable (chmod +x apache_log_alert.sh). 
Then run it with the log file name as the argument (./apache_log_alert.sh apache_logs). 
You can set up a cron job to run this script periodically.

# Task2
You'll need to configure the email plugin in Jenkins to send email alerts. Additionally, you'll need to set up environment variables for the container registry and cloud instance credentials.
